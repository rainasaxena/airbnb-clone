cd airbnb-clone


3. Install dependencies:
npm install

## Challenges Faced

During the development of this project, I encountered several challenges:

1. **App Drawer in Mobile View**: Implementing the app drawer in the mobile view was tricky due to the complex layout requirements and responsive design.

2. **Integration of Google Maps**: Integrating Google Maps was challenging, especially considering that it required a paid subscription. Finding suitable alternatives or workarounds was time-consuming.

3. **Data and Assets**: Lack of access to Airbnb's data and assets posed a challenge. I had to use placeholder images for rendering cards and substitute icons with Lucide React Icons.
